Project Description

This Python-based project leverages the power of Machine Learning and Computer Vision to create an efficient, accessible, and resource-friendly solution for security and monitoring applications. Designed to operate seamlessly even on low-end computers, the project utilizes lightweight libraries such as OpenCV, alongside other robust Python libraries, to deliver reliable performance without compromising on functionality.

Key Features
Real-Time Face Detection and Recognition

Incorporates advanced face recognition using custom-built KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) models for identifying individuals from a pre-trained dataset.
Optimized for real-time performance, ensuring fast and accurate detection even on hardware with limited processing power.
Fire Detection for Safety Monitoring

Implements a cascading fire detection mechanism using both Haar-based fire classifiers and HSV color thresholding to identify fire-like patterns.
Capable of detecting fire with high accuracy and sending immediate alerts via email notifications to ensure quick responses to emergencies.
Resource Efficiency

Designed with efficiency in mind, it minimizes computational overhead, making it suitable for systems with low memory and processing capabilities.
Intelligent optimizations ensure the project runs smoothly without requiring high-end GPUs or dedicated hardware.
Customizable and Scalable

Fully adaptable to integrate additional features such as motion detection, intrusion alerts, or other monitoring enhancements.
Can be scaled to meet broader security requirements, including multi-camera setups and cloud-based storage.
Alert Mechanisms

Includes real-time email notifications for fire detection, ensuring immediate action is taken to prevent property damage or loss of life.
